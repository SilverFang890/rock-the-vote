        <h2>Your Vote Makes a Difference</h2>
        <p>
          About two thirds (2/3, 66%) of elgible voters do not vote. Not only does this permit the government
          to take steps closer to ultimate power, it also works against the general population of the country.
          Would you mind the government controling your rent prices from now on (Prop 21)? Would you let the
          government take away suffrage from protestors who simply wanted change (Prop 17)? Even
          if you don't want to take to the streets to protest, VOTE in order to do your part in this democracy
          to control the government. WE, the citizens, control the government. Do not let it become the other
          way around.
        </P>
