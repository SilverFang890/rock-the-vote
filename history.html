        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p id="picDesc">
          Here are some statistics on voter turnout is the past elections. As you can see,
          there is a large chunk of the population that did not vote. In those parts of the
          population, various opinions would have definitely made a big difference on the
          outcome of any election. In the bottom right chart, you can see that less than
          40% of the 18-24 year old population voted for the 2018 midterm election. This is
          very troubling because this means that the country is mainly lead by the older groups
          in the population. The younger population must step up to the polling station and
          take lead of their country for a better future for theirselves and their children.

          "It is important for everyone to vote because every single vote truly matters.
          A single voter that doesn't vote because of their reasons, adds up to a whole fraction
          of the population."
