          As you can see, your vote counts more than you thought. It may be a single vote,
          but by voting, you are joining many people who voted for the same cause as you in
          order to cause the change they believe in. Will you sit back and let aristocrats
          to come back into society simply because of the lack of voters? NO, we will vote
          and join the many people that believe in the changes we do.
